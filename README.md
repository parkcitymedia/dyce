Dyce has been put on the backburner indefinitely. no further development is coming in the near future.

# Dyce
<h6>a tabletop utility originally developed for gtk+3, written in python3</h6>
<h3>FEATURES:</h3>
<p>- a dice rolling utility</p>
<h4>planned features:</h4>
<p>- a character sheet feature with a fully customizable workspace</p>
<p>- an "export preset" option for you and your party to share around if you play a slighty tweaked kind of any standard preset</p>
<p>- some default presets based on the bigger names in tabletop gaming (5e, 3.5-based spins, etc. ...)</p>
<p>- (this is going to take a lot of learning) a p2p-based board where actions and characters are moved in realtime</p>
<p>** a custom grid thingy for that</p>
<p>*** also support for "doorways" or enterances to other parts of a map</p>
<p>**** map grouping/tagging/nesting</p>
<p> dear lord that's ambitious</p>
